# Capstone!

This project is my Capstone Project for Neumont College of Computer Science.
The purpose of my capstone was to learn about renderering technologies,
and specifically about Direct3D11. Although I took a class about computer
graphics, I felt that I didn't understand it well enough and wanted to
gain a deeper understanding.

I also wanted an opportunity to use C++ more. I have used the language for
several classes in the past, but it is a deep and complicated language and
since it is very widely used I thought it wise to learn it better.

When deciding which API to use there were four major options: Direct3D11,
Direct3D12, OpenGL, and Vulkan. Under advisement from a friend I chose
Direct3D11 because, OpenGL is deprecated, and both Vulkan and Direct3D12
are a step up in complexity, therefore making Direct3D11 an obvious choice.

On reflection I think I could have learned what I wanted to by using OpenGL,
and may have been able to do so in less time since learning materials for
OpenGL seem to be more readily available. MSDN documentation seems to be
somewhat outdated and not very beginner friendly. I did make use of a textbook
(Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX11 by Frank Luna), however,
it was published in 2012. Most of the main concepts were the same, but there
were important sections which were entirely out of date. Fortunately I was
able to supplement my learning from Luna and MSDN with YouTube videos and
other online resources, and the invaluable indispensable help from my friend
and classmate [Alan Buechner](https://github.com/alanBuechner), as well as my teacher, Professor Raymond Maple.
