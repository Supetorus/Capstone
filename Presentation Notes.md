Capstone Presentation
## Introduction 1 minute
*What, why, personal*

Hello, my name is William Little. My capstone project is a 3D renderer for a game engine using Direct3D11. I chose this because I wanted to learn more about how 3D objects are draw to the screen in games and other CG environments. For my capstone project I wasn't interested as much in making something flashy and cool as I was developing industry skills.

## Demonstration

### Tricks to 3D
* Objects are displayed with perspective view, like a real-world camera and pinhole
* Objects are lit up

### Pillars
* Primary feature is that objects are rendered.
* Vertex Shader
* Pixel Shader
* Show obj file
* Run the program
* Move camera around scene
* Secondary feature is lighting

### Extras
* Translate, rotate, and scale objects in scene.
* Move and modify lights
* Save scene
* Move objects
* Reload scene

## Technologies
* C++
* Direct3D11
* Visual Studio

## Reflection
My purpose for this project was to learn industry skills and have a simple project to demonstrate those skills to recruiters. C++ is one of the top 4 programming languages in use today, so it was important to me that my project was written in C++. I had some experience in several previous classes writing C++, but I hadn't spent enough time outside of the required assignments learning the language to feel any degree of confidence in it. Although C++ is a deep and complex language, I certainly feel much more confident going into a job interview and talking about C++ now.

I chose Direct3D11 because it is less complicated than Direct3D12 and Vulkan, and because OpenGL will likely not be supported much longer. However, I think if I were to do it again I would have used OpenGL. If I wrote my project to use OpenGL I would have learned the same theory behind rendering, but the learning resources available for OpenGL are more abundant and up to date.

## Conclusion
In the future I would like to continue work on this project. There are two directions I could take this in.

I could continue to add features such as physics and more capable user interface to build up a game engine.

I could simplify and document the code so it can be used by others learning about Direct3D11.
